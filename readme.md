### Hi there! I'm Russ.

I make games in Godot and write tools with Clojure (Babashka). My games and
tools are open-source! Check out the projects below.

You can play my games on itch.io: [russmatney.itch.io](https://russmatney.itch.io)

I stream while developing to expose the process and workflow - follow me to get
notified when I'm live: [twitch.tv/russmatney](https://twitch.tv/russmatney)

I'm working on games full-time, and am trying to build up support via [Github
sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/russmatney) and
[Patreon](https://patreon.com/russmatney). My first goal is to reach the
per-month amount that I give to other projects :D
